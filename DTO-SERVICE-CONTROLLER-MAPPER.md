## Relationships Between DTOs, Controllers, Services, and Mappers in Spring Applications

**1. DTO (Data Transfer Object)**

* A lightweight object designed for data transfer between application layers (controller ↔ service, service ↔ external API).
* Contains a subset of properties from a complex domain model entity.
* Focuses on data exchange rather than complex business logic.
* Improves separation of concerns and data encapsulation.

**2. Controller**

* The entry point for user requests (often web API requests).
* Receives requests, interacts with services to process logic, and returns responses.
* Uses annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc. to handle different HTTP request types (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
* Typically receives and returns DTO objects, separating the API layer from the internal domain model.

**3. Service**

* Encapsulates the core business logic of an application.
* Interacts with repositories (data access), performs calculations/validations, and orchestrates functionalities.
* Doesn't have a direct dependency on the web layer (controllers).
* Might receive/return DTO objects (after conversion from/to entity format) for service communication.

**4. Mapper**

* Responsible for converting data between different formats (DTO ↔ Entity).
* Takes a DTO object and creates a corresponding entity object (and vice versa).
* Maintains clean separation of concerns and ensures proper data representation for each layer.

**Relationships:**

1. Controllers receive requests with data in an API-suitable format (often JSON/XML). This data might be mapped to a DTO object.
2. Controllers interact with services, passing DTO objects as arguments.
3. Services use DTO objects or retrieve data from repositories based on DTO information.
4. Services might use mappers to convert DTOs to entities before performing domain model operations.
5. Services process requests using business logic and might interact with other services/repositories.
6. To return data, services might convert entities back to DTOs using mappers.
7. Controllers receive DTOs (potentially after conversion from entity format) from services and prepare the response body.
8. Controllers return the HTTP response containing DTO data (often serialized to JSON/XML) to the client.

**Key Points:**

* DTOs facilitate data exchange between layers.
* Controllers handle requests and responses.
* Services encapsulate business logic and interact with repositories.
* Mappers translate between DTO and entity formats.
* These components work together for a well-structured and maintainable application.
