**1. Dependencies:**

* Include the following dependencies in your pom.xml or project dependencies:
    * Spring Security Web: Provides core security features like user management, authentication filters, and authorization checks.
    * Spring Security JWT (optional): If using JWT-based authentication, you'll need this dependency for JWT token processing.

**2. User Entity and UserDetails Implementation:**

* Create a `User` entity class representing your user data (e.g., ID, username, password, email).
* Implement the `UserDetails` interface from Spring Security. Create a custom class (e.g., `UserDetailsImpl`) extending `UserDetails` and overriding its methods to provide user details for authentication (username, password, authorities/roles).

**3. User Data Service:**

* Create a service (e.g., `UserDetailsServiceImpl`) implementing the `UserDetailsService` interface. 
* Implement the `loadUserByUsername` method to retrieve user details (including roles) from your database (e.g., JPA repository) based on the provided username.

**4. Security Configuration (`WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`):**

* Create a class extending `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` to configure Spring Security.
* Override methods to define security settings:
    * `configure(HttpSecurity http)`: Defines request authorization rules (e.g., permit all requests to `/api/auth/signup`, require authentication for other requests).
    * `authenticationProvider()`: Registers your custom authentication provider (optional, if using custom authentication logic).
    * `passwordEncoder()`: Configures a password encoder (e.g., BCryptPasswordEncoder) to securely hash user passwords before storing them.
* (Optional for JWT): Configure JWT settings like secret key and expiration time using properties or annotations.

**5. Authentication Mechanism (Optional):**

* Spring Security supports various authentication mechanisms like username/password, social login, etc.
  * For username/password, you typically rely on the default `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`.
  * For JWT-based authentication, you might create a custom JWT authentication filter to extract and validate JWT tokens from request headers.

**6. Authorization:**

* Define authorization rules in your `configure(HttpSecurity http)` method using `antMatchers` and `permitAll()`, `hasAnyRole`, `hasAuthority` methods.
* These rules specify which roles or authorities are required to access specific URLs or resources in your application.
