### Key Points About the Set

**Unique Elements**
The Set is a Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. It models the mathematical set abstraction. 

**Ordering**: 
The elements in a Set can be sorted in ascending order by using TreeSet implementation class. HashSet implementation class provides no ordering guarantees. The LinkedHashSet implementation class maintains the insertion order. 

**Null Elements**: 
All Set implementations permit, at most, one null element, if they permit null elements at all. 

**Methods**: 
The Set interface includes all the methods of the Collection interface and adds a stronger contract on the behavior of the equals and hashCode operations, allowing Set instances to be compared meaningfully even if their implementation types differ. 

**Subinterfaces and Implementations**: 
The commonly used classes that implement the Set interface are HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet. 

**No Position Access**: 
Unlike the List interface, the Set interface doesn't provide any methods to access the element by an index as Set doesn't maintain any fixed order. 

**Use-cases**: 
The Set is useful when you want to prevent duplicate values and do not care about the order of elements. 

**Equality**: 
Two Set objects are considered equal if they contain the same elements, regardless of the order. 

**Thread Safety**: 
None of the Set implementations in the Java Collection Framework are thread-safe. But you can make them thread-safe using `Collections.synchronizedSet()` and `CopyOnWriteArraySet`. 


### Set Methods

Below are the important Set interface methods with descriptions:
**boolean add(E e)** - This method adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present (optional operation).

**boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)** - This method adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this set if they're not already present (optional operation).

**_void clear()_** This method removes all of the elements from this set(optional operation).

**boolean contains(Object o)** - This method returns true if this set contains the specified element.

**boolean containsAll(Collection<?> c)** - This method returns true if this set contains all of the elements of the specified collection.

**boolean equals(Object o)** - This method compares the specified object with this set for equality.

**int hashCode()** - This method returns the hash code value for this set.

**boolean isEmpty()** - This method returns true if this set contains no elements.

**Iterator iterator()** - This method returns an iterator over the elements in this set.

**boolean remove(Object o)** - This method removes the specified element from this set if it is present (optional operation).

**boolean removeAll(Collection<?> c)** - This method removes from this set all of its elements that are contained in the specified collection (optional operation).

**boolean retainAll(Collection<?> c)** - This method retains only the elements in this set that are contained in the specified collection (optional operation).

**int size()** - This method returns the number of elements in this set (its cardinality).

**default Spliterator spliterator()**- This method creates a Spliterator over the elements in this set.
